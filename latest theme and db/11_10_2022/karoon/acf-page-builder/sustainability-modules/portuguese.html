<!-- Baúna, Santos Basin, Brazil -->

<h5><u>Concession BM-S-40</u></h5>
Baúna is located in concession BM-S-40, in the southern Santos Basin and comprises the Baúna and Piracaba light oil fields and the undeveloped Patola oil discovery. It is located approximately 50 kilometres from Karoon’s Neon and Goiá discoveries to the east and Clorita exploration block to the south. Production from Baúna includes 6 oil production wells, 3 water injection wells and 1 gas injection well from two separate reservoirs, Baúna and Piracaba.

All wells are subsea completions tied back to the floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel the “Cidade de Itajaí”. The FPSO has a processing capacity of 80,000 barrels of oil per day and a storage capacity of approximately 600,000 barrels. The FPSO is currently only utilising around 44% of its processing capacity and Karoon has already identified growth opportunities to increase flow rate and production through well interventions and the development of the Patola oil discovery.

The Baúna Oligocene reservoirs have excellent geological characteristics for production. The reservoirs sandstones are laterally extensive, 10 to 40m thick, typically approximately 30% porosity and 2 to 6 Darcy permeability, with good aquifer support and high recovery factors. The reservoirs occur around 2000 metres below sea level in combined stratigraphic and structural traps which are well delineated by a strong seismic response on high quality 3D seismic data.

Karoon signed agreements during September 2012 to farm-out a 35% interest to Pacific Exploration and Production Corp. (‘Pacific’), formerly, Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. Following Pacific applying for insolvency protection during April 2016 during September 2016, Karoon acquired Pacific’s 35% interest in the Blocks for an upfront cash payment of US$15.5 million and a contingent US$5 million payable on the production of a minimum of 1 mmboe.

Karoon has operated 2 drilling campaigns in the Blocks to date, drilling a total of 6 vertical wells, along with 2 side-tracks.

Exploration success resulted in the Kangaroo and Bilby light oil discoveries in 2013 which were followed by the Echidna light oil discovery in 2015. Both the Kangaroo and Echidna oil discoveries were ﬂow tested during 2015 producing encouraging results.

Following the last drilling campaign completed in May 2015, evaluation resulted in an update to the contingent resources announced in April 2018. In addition, Karoon has submitted fnal documentation to proceed to the Brazilian ANP ‘Declaration of Commerciality’ stage on areas covering the Echidna and Kangaroo oil discoveries.

S-M-1537 was acquired in ANP Bid Round 14 in 2017 after a lengthy evaluation of the southern Santos Basin blocks on oﬀer. The block was acquired for a low capital commitment consisting of seismic acquisition and geological studies. Block S-M-1537 provides an exciting low risk exploration opportunity, with the potential for hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. The main lead is targeting Oligocene turbidite sands with excellent reservoir porosity and permeability as seen in the producing Oligocene reservoirs of the Bauna and Piracaba oil felds. Seismic analysis shows an excellent Amplitude versus Oﬀset anomaly supportive of the presence of trapped oil.

Karoon has leveraged oﬀ its expertise and knowledge of the basin through the evaluation of Kangaroo and Echidna and nearby felds to high-grade it as the best prospect in the southern Santos Basin. With success there are many synergies to be had with the potential joint development at Kangaroo and Echidna.

<h5>Exploration History</h5>
During 2010, Karoon conducted the frst ever wide azimuth 3D seismic survey in Brazil. The results of this 3D seismic survey were integral to planning Karoon’s Phase 1 exploration drilling campaign completed during 2013.

During 2013, Karoon successfully completed its Phase 1 exploration drilling campaign comprising 3 wells which delivered signifcant early exploration success with oil discoveries at Kangaroo-1 and Bilby-1. The results at Emu-1 were also encouraging with good quality sands encountered with oil shows.

Following the successful initial phase of the Concession Agreements, a Discovery Appraisal Plan (Plano de Avaliação de Descobertas or “PAD”), which governs the next stage of the Concession Agreements, was approved during December 2013 by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (‘ANP’). The revised area of the Blocks under the PAD is approximately 549 square kilometers.

The follow-on phase 2 exploration and appraisal drilling campaign commenced during November 2014 and drilled the Kangaroo-2 appraisal well (December 2014), followed by the Kangaroo West-1 (March 2015) and the Echidna-1 (April 2015) exploration wells. This drilling campaign was designed to better defne the Kangaroo discovery contingent resource size and quality, obtain a production test and drill proximate exploration targets.

Karoon was awarded a southern Santos Basin exploration Block, S-M-1537, located in the state of Santa Catarina, oﬀshore Brazil, as part of ANP Bid Round 14 in September 2017.
