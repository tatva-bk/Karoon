<h2>Environment</h2>
<section class="karoon-cms-content-wrapper">
   <div class="karoon-container sm">
      <p>Karoon is committed to delivering safe and reliable operations that respect our local environments by minimising
            impact, protecting biodiversity and seeking continuous improvement in operations. This is achieved through careful
            monitoring, aiming to achieve full compliance with all environmental regulations and licence requirements, and
            through implementation of our specifically designed environmental plans.
      </p>
      <p>
            This is in addition to the work Karoon is undertaking to address the climate change impacts of our operations by
            making our Baúna operations carbon neutral on Scope 1 and 2 emissions and targeting Net Zero 2035 (Scope 1 and
            2).

      <h2>Environmental Monitoring</h2>
      <p>Environmental monitoring is carried out in four main areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Water and Plankton Monitoring – through analysis of physical-chemical and biological data collected from water and plankton samples taken at various points around the FPSO</li>
        <li>Sediment and Benthic Monitoring – through analysis of physical-chemical and biological data collected from marine sediment samples</li>
        <li>Produced Water Monitoring – on a daily basis of oil and grease content in discharged water and an additional twice yearly special sample collection</li>
        <li>Spill Monitoring – through monitoring and analysis of metocean data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Karoon has consistently returned results within allowable regulatory parameters, generally significantly outperforming
        the environmental requirements of our licence. Details of Karoon’s environmental performance statistics can be
        found in our annual Sustainability Repor
      </p>

      <h2>Water Management</h2>
      <p>With water scarcity affecting more than 40% of the world’s population, Karoon recognises that sustainable water
            management is an important contributor to climate resilience. Fresh water is used in Karoon offices and shore bases
            through the public water supply. The only fresh water used in offshore operations is that required for consumption
            by employees and service providers and is transported from shore. Freshwater is only used for operational purposes
            on supply vessels, which is obtained from the shorebase water supply.
        </p>

      <h2>Waste Management Plan</h2>
      <p>The Baúna waste management plan, also called the Pollution Control Plan, ensures waste is minimised wherever possible and that any residual waste is properly treated and disposed of through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimising the generation of waste, wastewater and emissions in production activities</li>
        <li>Recycling as much of the waste returned onshore as possible</li>
        <li>Ensuring the final disposal of residual waste is in accordance with current standards and regulations </li>
        <li>Seeking ongoing improvements to minimise pollution from air emissions, solid waste and wastewater discharge at sea.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Environmental Protection</h2>
    <p>In addition to our regulatory licence projects, Karoon has sought opportunities to undertake projects aimed at protecting the local environment. One such project is the Sun Coral Project, in which Karoon is providing funding for research of sun coral and how local environments can be protected from sun coral invasion.</p>

    <h2>Environmental Contributions</h2>
    <p>As an oil producer in Brazil, Karoon provides significant environmental contributions (environmental compensation payments) to protect state and federal parks in Brazil. The payments for Baúna total more than US$1.8 million and contribute to the upkeep and protection of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arvoredo Marine Biological Reserve (Federal)</li>
        <li>National Park Superagui (Federal)</li>
        <li>Taim Ecological Station (Federal)</li>
        <li>Lagoa do Peixe National Park (Federal)</li>
        <li>Ecological Park Serra do Tabuleiro (Santa Catarina State).</li>

        <li><strong>Safety</strong>is our highest priority, a state of mind in respect of personnel, community and the environment</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> is honestly doing what is right and what we say we will do.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> is working together, to achieve our goals and striving for better outcomes for all stakeholders.</li>
        <li><strong>Commitment</strong> is following through on our promises with focus, passion and dedication.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect</strong> is actively listening to, harnessing and embracing different backgrounds, cultures, thoughts and ideas.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Our values, purpose, mission and vision all recognise in some way the sustainability challenges and opportunities facing Karoon and our commitment to operating as an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable Company. In defining our strategic framework, we have sought to communicate to all stakeholders our clear path forward as an oil company committed to safe, reliable and responsible operations.</p>

     <h2>Operating with Integrity and Respect</h2>
     <p>Karoon strives to foster a culture that reflects our values. Where any member of our team or any of our stakeholders have a concern that business is not being conducted in accordance with our Code of Conduct, grievance mechanisms are in place. Karoon encourages employees and stakeholders to speak up without fear of intimidation or reprisal and will protect those who do so. Karoon has a Grievance Policy and Misconduct Investigation Protocol in place, as well as a Whistleblower Protection Policy. We offer an anonymous whistleblower reporting service, available in both Portuguese and English, that enables reports to be made via telephone, email and internet</p>

     <h2>Diversity</h2>
     <p>Karoon employs a diverse team of dedicated and passionate professionals with great depth of experience, which
        is the key to our success. We value the diversity of thinking that comes not just from gender diversity but from
        our range of nationalities across our Brazilian and Australian offices and range of experience from young interns
        to experts with more than 40 years’ experience. We are working to achieve 30% female participation at senior
        executive and board level by 2025. Across the Karoon Group more than 45% of our employees are female.
    </p>
    <p>
        We strive to be an employer of choice by offering all staff a safe and engaging workplace, where our employees are
        encouraged to continue to grow their skills in a supportive and respectful environment. In addition to our suite of
        policies and procedures governing professional conduct at Karoon, we offer all employees access to a number of
        wellbeing services such as gym membership and 24 hour Employee Assistance Program for employees and their
        families
    </p>

    <h2>Human Rights in our Supply Chain</h2>
    <p>
        Our policies are communicated to our suppliers and specific clauses included in contracts relating to health, safety,
        security and environment, anti-bribery and corruption and human rights and modern slavery. Karoon undertakes
        due diligence on our suppliers prior to commencement, and suppliers meeting our engagement threshold are
        asked to complete questionnaires to assist Karoon in identifying risks within our supply chain. The results of the due
        diligence and questionnaire responses are reviewed and assessed. Where potential risks are identified, Karoon is
        committed to working with suppliers to try and alleviate these risks. Further details are available in our <a href="javascript:void(0);">Sustainability Report.</a>

            <h2>Project RUMO</h2>
            <p>Karoon’s operations, located more than 200 kilometres offshore, do not have a day to day impact on onshore communities. However, we work hard to ensure our stakeholders, including our staff, contractors, local communities, regulatory authorities and others, are well informed about our operations</p>
            <p>
                Karoon is undertaking a major social monitoring project called Project RUMO, in the Itajaí region, where our
                shorebase is located. The acronym RUMO is the same in Portuguese and English and stands for ‘Resilience and
                Union for Marine Organization’. The project seeks to investigate the use of the maritime zone and the coastal
                space of the Itajaí-Açu River estuary, where there are risks posed by the interaction of small and large vessels. The
                valuable information collected will be used to help plan for safe and economically efficient use of the river going
                forward. https://projetorumo.com.br/en/

            <h2>Creating Sustainable Economic Opportunities in Local Communities</h2>
            <p>Pró-CREP (Create, Recycle, Educate, Preserve) is a social environmental project that provides work with steady
                    income to 64 families in socially vulnerable situations. In addition, Pró-CREP aims to protect the environment by
                    raising awareness of the correct methods of recycling by building and supplying recycling containers to be installed
                    in the communities that are located around the border of the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="title-content-block">
        <p>The Pró-CREP facilities include a Container Production Workshop and a waste recycling centre which provides
                    equipment for waste to be repurposed and a small retail area where recycled goods are sold. The Container
                    Production Workshop will initially produce 50 large recycling units. These containers facilitate the segregation of
                    solid waste so that as much as possible can be recycled.</p>
            <p>They will be placed at various locations in communities around the border of the park to reduce waste in and
                    around the park. Community education services regarding the proper recycling of waste will be provided to local
                    communities to ensure the bins are used correctly.</p>
            <p>It is estimated that through Karoon’s participation in the project, the amount of solid waste going to landfill in the
                    local area will reduce by approximately 25 tonnes per month.</p>
            <p>The income generated from the sale of containers will be used to increase production and ensure the project is
                sustainable, with a view to expanding to include at least 12 more families during financial year 2023.</p>

            <p>Santa Catarina’s native guinea pig, Cavia Intermedia, also known as Preá de Moleques do Sul, is currently only found
                    in the Moleques do Sul Archipelago, (contained within the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park) and is listed as Critically
                    Endangered. Karoon is sponsoring an Environmental Education Program for the conservation of Cavia Intermedia.
                    The program aims to increase knowledge and awareness of the plight of the guinea pig and assist in controlling park
                    access to help ensure people using the park do so responsibly, and minimise any impacts on the native habitat.</p>
            <p>
                The project encourages local communities to become more involved in the conservation effort through an
                education program in public schools. Karoon will provide certified training courses for 100 biology teachers about
                the importance of protecting habitats for biodiversity, along with learning materials to reach approximately 1,600
                local students. A “Preá Centre” will be created at each school to encourage them to produce their own projects.
                Karoon is offering to award the best 10 projects with a “Preá” kit and field trip by boat to the island. A range of socioenvironmental events are also planned.
            </p>
            <p>
            Karoon is also intending to sponsor the publication and release of approximately 5,000 copies of a book about
                the history of Cavia Intermedia’s discovery and the conservation efforts, along with thousands of posters, folders,
                banners and videos provided to 30 marinas and 9 fishing associations.

<h2>Health safety and security</h2>
<section class="karoon-cms-content-wrapper">
   <div class="karoon-container sm">
        <p>People are the heart of our business and their safety is our priority. Our focus on health, safety and environment is reflected in our fully integrated operating management system that defines Karoon’s high expectations of safety and integrity in all operations. Since taking operatorship of the producing Baúna oil field in November 2020 Karoon has been working closely with the Baúna FPSO operator, Altera & Ocyan, to ensure Karoon’s commitment to health, safety and environment is imbedded throughout the Baúna operations, as it is throughout the organisation. This includes linking remuneration to safety performance.</p>
        <p>Karoon’s health and safety statistics are reported annually in our Annual Report and Sustainability Report. Four Lost Time Incidents (LTI) were recorded in financial year 2022 (FY2022) with no Medical Treatment Injuries (MTI) or Restricted Work Cases (RWC), resulting in a Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) and a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of 0.77 (per 200,000 work hours).</p>
        <p>During FY2022 Karoon commenced work on the Baúna intervention campaign using the Maersk Developer rig. We have been working with Maersk for more than a year as we aim to ensure that our safety first culture is embedded in all operations.</p>

        <h2>Managing the impacts of Covid-19</h2>
            <p>Karoon’s operations and the majority of Karoon’s employees are located in Brazil, a country particularly hard hit by
                the Covid-19 pandemic. While there have been Covid-19 cases recorded in Karoon offices and operations globally,
                all impacted employees have made a full recovery and there have been no interruptions to operations due to
                Covid-19. This success in delivering safe and reliable operations is largely due to the rigorous quarantine program
                and other Covid-19 safety protocols implemented throughout the operations.</p>

        <h2>Risk Management</h2>
        <p>Karoon understands that the careful management of risks and opportunities is critical to achieving a successful
            and sustainable business. Karoon’s risk management framework is well established and is regularly reviewed and
            updated as our business grows and we respond to the expectations of our key stakeholders.</p>
        <p>The process for identifying risks and opportunities is undertaken at several levels within the organisation. Activity
        level risk assessments are undertaken to ensure no activity is carried out if it poses an unacceptable level of risk to
        personnel or environmental safety. Project level risk assessments are carried out for any potential investment to
        seek to ensure both risks and opportunities are identified to optimise investment decision making. Overall business
        risks are considered in the context of both corporate and operational risks, including climate-related transition and
        physical risks, and these are reviewed by the Board on a regular basis. Further details of Karoon’s risk management
        framework are available in our<a href="javascript:void(0);">Sustainability Report.</a></p>

        <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
        <p>The global rise in cyber attacks and the increasingly professional nature of the attacks launched by cyber-criminal
        organisations are presenting enterprises with the challenge of developing, implementing and constantly reviewing
        cyber security strategies. Operators of critical infrastructure need to implement a cybersecurity strategy that ensures
        comprehensive protection of their data, production facilities and critical IT systems. Protection against specific
        cyber attacks is therefore an important part of the overall IT architecture at Karoon Energy. Karoon’s Cybersecurity
        Plan uses the four principles of reliability, accuracy, architecture and resilience to protect our systems and prevent
        intrusions. Further details are available in our<a href="javascript:void(0);">Sustainability Report.</a>

        to mitigate natural decline from Baúna through active well management and grow production through the Baúna
        intervention program and developing the Patola field. It is also pursuing value-accretive organic and inorganic growth
        opportunities, leveraging off the Company’s core operating skills. Karoon is integrating sustainability, including Scope
        1 and 2 carbon neutrality and longer term, Net Zero by 2035 (Scope 1 and 2 emissions), into its strategic decision
        framework.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Brazil?</h2>
        <p>Karoon entered Brazil in 2007, following the award of five exploration blocks in the offshore Santos Basin. Currently,
            Karoon has a 100% working interests in four blocks, which contain the producing Baúna field and undeveloped Patola
            field, the Neon and Goiá oil discoveries, and the Clorita exploration prospect
        </p>
        <p>
        Brazil is an attractive place to invest in the oil and gas industry due to the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>High prospectivity for oil and gas in offshore conventional reservoirs</li>
            <li>Well-established oil and gas industry, with a stable regulatory regime.</li>
            <li>Favourable tax-royalty contract terms for post-salt licences</li>
            <li>Well-developed drilling and services sector</li>
            <li>World class professional labour force.</li>
            <li>Active asset trade market.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Previously dominated by State-owned Petrobras, the Brazilian upstream sector was opened up to foreign investment in
        1998, through the first Bid Round. Brazil now has a diverse set of international companies, including BP, Shell, Chevron
        and Equinor, active in all aspects of exploration and production, as well as numerous smaller independent companies,
        such as Karoon. The internationalisation of the Brazilian oil and gas industry has brought access to global financial
        markets, with the sector well served by debt and equity markets, providing the capital required to fund operations and
        support growth projects.
        </p>
        <p>In 2021, Brazil was the world’s 10th largest oil producer, averaging 3.5 million barrels of oil per day, or approximately
        3.5% of global supply. Brazil is targeting to become the world’s fifth largest oil producer by 2030, with more than US$20
        billion per annum expected to be invested into exploration and production by Petrobras, major companies and the
        independents. Driving this growth is the development of a number of giant discoveries made in recent years in the presalt basins. In addition, there remains significant untapped potential due to a large number of prospective sedimentary
        basins which are only lightly explored
        </p>
        <p>The service sector backing the industry is well developed. The world’s leading drilling contractors and well servicing
        and evaluation companies are active and competitive in Brazil, with established in-country operations. For oil and gas
        companies, there is a deep pool of highly trained geoscientists and engineers.
        </p>
        <p>While most of the major oil companies are focused on finding and developing large pre-salt fields, some older and
        smaller assets are being divested by these companies. Karoon believes that given its current size, production base, core
        skills and access to capital, it is well positioned to participate in future asset transaction processes, either alone or in
        partnership with like-minded companies
        </p>
        <p>The majority of Brazil’s oil production is from the Santos and Campos basins. Karoon’s operations are located in the western part of the Santos Basin

<h2>Reserves & Resources</h2>
<div class="karoon-cms-content-wrapper">
    <div class="karoon-container sm">
        <p>Karoon’s internal assessment of 2P Reserves at 30 June 2022 is 44.8 MMbbl, with the decline from the prior year’s 2P Reserves estimate of 49.4 MMbbl reflecting production for the year of 4.6 MMbbl</p>
        <p>During FY2022, Karoon finalised reprocessing of seismic and carried out reservoir modelling and dynamic simulation work on Baúna. The resolution of the reprocessed seismic is significantly better than legacy datasets, decreasing the uncertainty on field volumes. The results of this work, together with recent production history and information from the Baúna intervention campaign currently underway, are being incorporated into a Reserves reassessment. Once this work is completed, a revised Reserves and Resources statement will be released at that time, if required.</p>
